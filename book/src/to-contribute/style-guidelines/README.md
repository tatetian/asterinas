# Style Guidelines

This section describes the coding and collaboration conventions
for the Asterinas project.
Consistent style makes the codebase easier to read, review, and maintain.

These guidelines complement the
[Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
and are derived from recurring patterns
observed in code reviews.

The style guidelines are organized into the following pages:

- **[General Guidelines](general-guidelines.md)** —
  Naming, documentation, code organization, formatting,
  error messages, design principles, and comment style.
- **[Rust Guidelines](rust-guidelines.md)** —
  API documentation, lints, formatting, imports,
  unsafe code, error handling, and concurrency.
- **[Git Guidelines](git-guidelines.md)** —
  Commit messages, commit organization, and pull requests.
- **[Testing Guidelines](testing-guidelines.md)** —
  Test naming, assertions, cleanup, and regression tests.
- **[Assembly Guidelines](asm-guidelines.md)** —
  Section definitions, function definitions,
  and x86-64/RISC-V conventions.
