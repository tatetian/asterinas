  Early returns, iterators, builders, and helper extraction.
- **[Types and Traits](types-and-traits.md)** —
  Generics, enums vs. trait objects,
  type-level invariants, and simplification.
- **[Comments and Documentation](comments-and-documentation.md)** —
  Doc comment formatting, RFC 505, rustdoc links,
  and public API coverage.
- **[Unsafety](unsafety.md)** —
  SAFETY comments, `# Safety` sections,
  scope minimization, and soundness reasoning.
- **[Modules and Crates](modules-and-crates.md)** —
  Visibility, workspace dependencies, imports,
  and module organization.
- **[Macros and Attributes](macros-and-attributes.md)** —
